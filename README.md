### Course Goals
This is an intermediate level course about programming in Python. Students are expected to know data structure beforehand. 

After finishing this course, students should be able to:
- Understand python code,
- Write and debug python programs,
- Implement algorithms using python,
- Apply python to solve various practical problems.

### Prerequisites
- A Grade of B or better in a programming course, such as COP 3330. Most of the homeworks will ask you to write code. 
- You should have already taken the Data Structures course. Come and talk to me if you do not have the prerequisite and you still want to take the course. 
- Github, which will be used to distribute course materials, and handle quizzes and the final project.

### Textbook
- Python Application Programming, by Piyush Kumar and Biswas Parajuli. ISBN 978-0- 9981694-0-8
- http://pybook.rocks
- https://docs.python.org/3/index.html

### Grading Policy
The final course grade will be computed as follows:


|Tasks| Scores|
|---| ---|
|Attendance| 10 |
|Quizzes| 40 |
|Final Project| 20 |
|Final Exam|30|

### Late Assignment Policy
Students are expected to turn their assignments in on or before the due date. Late assignments will suffer a 10 percentage point penalty for the first 24 hour period. For example, an assignment worth 200 points turned in late will receive a 20 point penalty. Assignments turned in more than a day after the due date will receive a grade of `0', but you can still have it graded and receive feedback.

### Academic Honor Code
The Florida State University Academic Honor Policy outlines the University's expectations for the integrity of students? academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process.  Students are responsible for reading the Academic Honor Policy and for living up to their pledge to ". . . be honest and truthful and . . . [to] strive for personal and institutional integrity at Florida  State University." (Florida State University Academic Honor Policy, found at http://dof.fsu.edu/honorpolicy.htm). Assignments/projects/exams are to be done individually, unless specified otherwise. It is a violation of the Academic Honor Code to take credit for the work done by other people. It is also a violation to assist another person in violating the Code (See the FSU Student Handbook for penalties for violations of the Honor Code). The judgment for the violation of the Academic Honor Code will be done by the instructor and a third party member (another faculty member in the Computer Science Department not involved in this course). Once the judgment is made, the case is closed and no arguments from the involved parties will be heard. Examples of cheating behaviors include:

1). Discuss the solution for a homework question.
2). Copy programs for programming assignments.
3). Use and submit existing programs/reports on the world wide web as written assignments.
4). Submit programs/reports/assignments done by a third party, including hired and contracted.
5). Plagiarize sentences/paragraphs from others without giving the appropriate references.
Penalty for violating the Academic Honor Code: A 0 grade for the particular assignment/quiz/exam and a reduction of one letter grade in the final grade for all parties involved for each occurrence. A report will be sent to the department chair for further administrative actions. 
### Accommodation for Disabilities
Students with disabilities needing academic accommodations should: 1) register with and provide documentation to the Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC), and 2) bring a letter to the instructor indicating the need for accommodation and what type. This should be done within the first week of class. This syllabus and other class materials are available in alternative format upon request.
